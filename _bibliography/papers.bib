  title={TraveLER: A Modular Multi-LMM Agent Framework for Video Question-Answering},
  author={Chuyi Shang*, Amos You, Sanjay Subramanian, Trevor Darrell, Roi Herzig},
  abstract={Recently, image-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in video question-answering (VideoQA) using a frame-wise approach by leveraging large-scale pretraining in a zero-shot manner. Nevertheless, these models need to be capable of finding relevant information, extracting it, and answering the question simultaneously. Currently, existing methods perform all of these steps in a single pass without being able to adapt if insufficient or incorrect information is collected. To overcome this, we introduce a modular multi-LMM agent framework based on several agents with different roles, instructed by a Planner agent that updates its instructions using shared feedback from the other agents. Specifically, we propose TraveLER, a method that can create a plan to "Traverse" through the video, ask questions about individual frames to "Locate" and store key information, and then "Evaluate" if there is enough information to answer the question. Finally, if there is not enough information, our method is able to "Replan" based on its collected knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed TraveLER approach improves performance on several VideoQA benchmarks without the need to fine-tune on specific datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/traveler-framework/TraveLER},

  title={LUSE: Using LLMs for Unsupervised Step Extraction in Instructional Videos},
  author={Chuyi Shang*, Emi Tran*, Medhini Narasimhan, Sanjay Subramanian, Dan Klein, Trevor Darrell},
  abstract={In this work, we introduce an unsupervised languageonly approach to automatically segment and identify steps in instructional videos. Parsing a video into its steps has several use cases-training video action recognition models to recognize steps, creating visual summaries highlighting relevant steps, identifying mistakes in steps of the video, and retrieving/localizing steps in the video to name a few. Our framework LUSE, zero-shot prompts a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract steps from the transcript of a single instructional video. Next, the steps across several videos of the same task are consolidated to generate a general set of steps for the task, via a second pass through the LLM, and are then localized back in the transcript of each video. Existing datasets for steps rely on manual annotations which are expensive to collect and oftentimes subjective. Our fully automated approach overcomes these issues and generates competitive quality step labels, as highlighted by our qualitative examples. Furthermore, we fine-tune a state-of-theart image captioning model on our generated steps to show that the resulting output has better qualitative step descriptions and denser coverage compared to existing manually annotated datasets.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
