# Review
I can say with confidence that this is probably my favorite class that I've taken at Berkeley so far. Perhaps not coincidentally, it's also one of the only actual economics classes I've taken here. Ultimately, this class has reminded me why I loved economics so much and has motivated me to continue exploring the field.

## Econ 100A or 101A?
This seems to always be the biggest question surrounding this course. Econ 101A is the more math-intensive version of its commonly taken sister course, Econ 100A. In 101A, a lot more emphasis is placed on the mathematical workings behind the theory, which was something that I really enjoyed. Instead of simply knowing a theorem and blindly applying it, understanding the mathematical workings behind it allowed me to see *why* certain things were true. How do you quantify altruism? Why do some people always prefer current consumption to future consumption? These were all questions that could be modeled mathematically, tweaked, and solved. I think the process of exploring the underlying math behind the intuition of the theories really helped me gain a more foundational understading of how everything connected together, which I found infinitely valuable.

Moreover, despite being more challenging in terms of the math, the class itself has a better curve. However, I think the most important distinction from 100A is that the class size is much smaller. Instead of the 400-800 people in class for 100A, our class had only a total of around 150 people (which is really good for Berkeley standards for a required lower-division class). This allowed the professor and the 2 GSI's to know many of the students by name and allowed students to ask many questions during lectures and sections. More attention was placed on a fewer amount of students, which also made things like office hours and sections much more accessible and fruitful.

## Professors + GSIs





Speaking of intuition, one thing that I really liked about the class was Stefano and the GSI's emphasis on developing economic intuition. Economics has a unique and at times rather peculiar way of viewing different events - just take the reversed axes in your typical supply and demand graph, for example. However, I think
