# Living alone
It's been a bit more than a week since I've moved out of my cramped Unit 3 dorm room into my own place. To be more precise, my own place that I'm going to be sharing with 5 other roommates. But unlike the dorms, there is no feeling of claustrophobia here - it's a big place, with enough room for many more than our meager 6.

## Moving in
Moving in turned out to be a lot more painful than originally anticipated. Maybe it was the mass of discarded furniture left behind by the previous tenants, or the empty space, but the place didn't feel like home at all. Facing an empty room and perched on a naked mattress with no sheets, I found myself adding to an ever-growing shopping list. From the most mundane - cups, coat hangers, and toilet paper, to the more imaginative "what if I got a bean bag for my room?", it seemed like there was no end to the list of things that would be needed to transform a place into a home. I realized that I took a lot of things for granted when living with my parents and living in the dorms - things that were always there and familiar like dressers, desks, and kitchenware were suddenly and strangely absent. Obtaining all these items felt like a Herculean task for both my body and for my wallet.

In the end, it took more than a week to get everything settled. During this time, I probably totalled around 5 trips to Ikea, 10+ hours assembling furniture, and many hundreds of dollars spent on furniture. And yet, despite this trouble, it was ultimately very rewarding. Getting to design a space from start to finish gave me a sense of agency. Whereas previously I had limited choice over my surroundings, I now had complete control, from the actual items all the way to the specific colors of each. Starting from nothing also forced me to minimize my belongings and obtain only the most necessary ones. I now felt a deeper connection to the space I occcupy and felt much more comfortable at home.
