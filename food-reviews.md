# Food Reviews

I've been fortunate enough to be able to try a lot of new and different foods over the years and across the world. My current goal at Berkeley is to try as many new restaurants in the area as possible. So far, I've been making steady progress towards this goal, but while it's been good for my stomach, it has not been as kind to my wallet. Regardless, I'm going to start documenting this journey as much as I can, along with some of the other places that I've enjoyed greatly over the years.
