Hello there! My name is Chuyi Shang, and I'm currently a rising sophomore at UC Berkeley. My primary interests include economics research, automating things, and teaching! My secondary interests include playing the electric guitar, sports, and browsing through Wikipedia.

I was born in California (Fremont!!) and lived there for 11 years before moving to Shanghai, where I completed most of middle school and high school. In a sense, coming back to the Bay Area for college has closed the loop!

I started this page mainly to incentivize myself to write more coherently and to share some of my musings. Hopefully, you'll find some of them interesting as well!
