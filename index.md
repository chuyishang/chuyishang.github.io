Hello there! My name is Chuyi Shang, and I am currently an incoming sophomore at UC Berkeley. My primary interests include economics research, automating things, and teaching! My secondary interests include playing the electric guitar, sports, and browsing through Wikipedia. 

I started this page with the intention of forcing myself to write better and clearly, but more importantly, write _more_. If you have any feedback on anything at all, feel free to contact me [here]({% link contact.md %}).
