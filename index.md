Hello there! My name is Chuyi Shang, and I am currently an incoming sophomore at UC Berkeley. My primary interests include economics research, automating things, and teaching! My secondary interests include playing the electric guitar, sports, and browsing through Wikipedia. 

I started this page with the intention of getting myself to write more and articulate myself more clearly, and I'm happy that you are here reading this!
